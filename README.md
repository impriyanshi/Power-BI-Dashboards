This repository contains a Power Bi project:

**HR Analytics Dashboard:** A dashboard that displays HR data for a company, including Attrition count of Employees, Job Satisfaction rate, and Job Roles based on different departments and gender.

I have prepared the charts which covers the various objectives-
- Attrition by Education
- Attrition by Age
- Job Satisfaction Score
- Job Attrition by Job Rate
- Attrition by Salary Slab
- Attrition by Years at Company

Below is the glance of my dashboard.
